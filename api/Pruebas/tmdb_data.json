I had to check it out for myself to get it watched before I got spoiled. Sometimes the internet piles in to jointly overhate a movie... this is not one of those times.\r\n\r\nWhat a mess, there are sadly no redeeming qualities to it. First and foremost, it takes itself way too seriously. There are (I think) a few jokes scattered in there, though they last for literal seconds - everything else is played straight. It had a better chance of working as a comedy, albeit barely.\r\n\r\nThe initial novelty of the \"screenlife\" (never knew that was a thing until now) set-up is kinda interesting, though it very quickly wears off completely. It ends up getting annoying, especially the constant calling noises - almost gave me a headache. It'd work as a short, not for 90mins!\r\n\r\nThe computer stuff looks quite awful too, the most boring and least creative way of utilizing the whole PC concept too. They literally just zoom in and out for the entire flick. There is one scene where they do the <em>'Jaws'</em> dolly zoom effect, which is minorly cool to be fair.\r\n\r\nThere is also a piece of photoshop right at the end that is hilariously bad, I'm pretty certain I could do a better job... OK, maybe not, but you know. The whole ending had me chuckling (negatively) at the film, with that aforementioned moment but also with that flying delivery thing.\r\n\r\nI've got this far into this (overly long) review without noting the acting talent. It has a few good names attached, but none of them do anything remotely standout - but, in fairness, have barely anything to work with. You could place any world leading lad or lass in this and it'd be the same.\r\n\r\nIce Cube... I'm gonna let this one slide, because I do like him. Same goes for Eva Longoria. Both of 'em are, erm, not good though. The only actor I'd give a tiny solace of praise to would be Devon Bostick (Rodrick to you and I), who has one scene where his teary eyes look kinda convincing. As you can see, I'm reaching!\r\n\r\nI don't know what's worse. This movie, or the fact that I've just typed up seven paragraphs about it. We're both as bad as each other! This only avoids the bottom rating from yours truly through comparison. Incredibly, I have seen worse."

Wells's classic 1898 novel. The fundemental message of the book - humans are in reality nothing more than a vulnerable race even now in the 21st century despite our overwhelming dependence on the technology-driven infrastructure we use every day - remains the same, but it is indeed ironic this technology should be used to assist in the telling of the story. The problematic drawback with this technique lies in the fact it is like watching a live action video game and the unfolding drama surrounding the dilemmas and traumas the various characters we are supposed to care about are enduring quickly becomes desperately abstract as any global disaster inevitably does when it is reduced to being nothing more than television news feeds and the deceased are merely a list of numbers on a screen. The resulting film only manages to scrape the surface of the characters and the devastating invasion itself to create the illusion of reality without the necessary emotional depth required which only genuine characterisation can provide for it to truly resonate with an audience."

Ufotable has once again shattered expectations, delivering what is arguably the greatest animation ever seen in anime history. Every frame of Infinity Castle is a painting. Every battle is a symphony of light, color, movement, and emotion.\r\n\r\nThe sheer scale of the Infinity Castle arc is staggering. Shifting gravity, kaleidoscopic architecture, and relentless pacing pull you into a world that feels boundless and terrifying. And through this madness, the animators create visual clarity and storytelling precision that defy logic. The fights aren’t just flashy—they’re intimate, brutal, and deeply emotional. You feel every breath, every strike, every sacrifice.\r\n\r\nTanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and the Hashira face impossible odds with a sense of weight and urgency that grips your chest. Character moments hit harder than ever. The Upper Moons are terrifying in both presence and power. And Muzan? An absolute force of dread.\r\n\r\nWhat truly sets Infinity Castle apart isn’t just the spectacle—though it is unparalleled. It’s the way the animation serves the heart of the story. Loyalty, grief, fury, and love are painted across the screen with every cut, every cry, every flicker of a blade.\r\n\r\nThis is peak anime. A cultural milestone. A visual symphony.\r\nDemon Slayer: Infinity Castle is what happens when anime dares to be legendary.\r\n\r\n🔥 A flawless 10/10. Nothing comes close. 🔥"

I felt that they tried to squeeze too many side stories in one movie. In the first 2/3 of the movie, you keep going back and forth from fight scenes to side stories, which breaks the tempo. It was not well executed, and I would have preferred if they just finished one side story and then come back to the fight scenes to finish it. Also, many side stories were finished in rush, which did not add much context of emotions.\r\n\r\nOverall, the actions sequences and sound effects were great. I think they have 2 more movies linked up to finale, and hope they conclude the story in a more meaningful way."

With the ultimate battle against “Muzan” getting ever closer, they must first face the mighty “Akaza” who has not only a remarkable arsenal of quirks and skills, but also something hitherto unseen by our intrepid “Tanjiro” - bit how to defeat it? It’s a film that starts as we are used to, with end to end combat scenes but around the midway point, we flip the vinyl over and enter onto an altogether more informative path. We are being told of the tragedies that touched the life of “Akaza” before his demonic days. We learn of a time when he was capable of love and affection, but was in turn subject to the most heinous of betrayals that left his soul vulnerable to the temptations of a life where revenge on those who offended him (think “Anakin Skywalker” a little bit) when offered to him. It is good to see little more in-depth characterisation going on in this film, it helps us to balance the forces of good and evil and there is more than plenty action to keep the pace moving and avoid that backstory becoming too melancholic. The setting within the aptly named “Infinity Castle” challenges linear perspectives effectively with an effective sense of the multi-dimensional that allows the artists (and the CGI) to assume something gossamer-like as solid structures melt and what is down becomes up and gravity takes a back seat. It has some gore to it, and some scenes aren’t for the faint-hearted, but it’s the best yet of the “Demon Slayer” movies and stands alone, well."

The pacing is relentless but never empty, balancing spectacle with raw emotion as Tanjiro and the Hashira face their darkest trials yet. While it’s clearly setting the stage for an epic trilogy (with 2027 and 2029 still looming), this first entry stands tall on its own—delivering both tragedy and triumph in equal measure.

                "content": "Director Francis Lawrence’s screen adaptation of Stephen King’s novel by the same name is one of those pictures that makes me want to stand up in the theater and exclaim that the Emperor is indeed naked (though I’d probably be quickly escorted from the moviehouse if I did so). The source material for this production, originally written at the time of the Vietnam War, was an allegory about the draft and its impact on young American men at the time, a mandate that often led to their deaths in an unpopular and largely unexplained conflict. And it’s a statement that’s admittedly still valid (albeit perhaps not as relevant) all these many years later. However, the story’s translation from book to screen in the present day leaves much to be desired, in part because its message isn’t as timely as when the book was written and in part because of the film’s stunningly poor execution. “The Long Walk” tells the tale of a feebly justified (and even more poorly explained) grim ritual in which 50 young men selected from a nationwide lottery embark on a nonstop march in which they must maintain a minimum 3 mph walking speed. Their determined efforts in this symbolic venture are supposedly intended to inspire the population to become more productive citizens in a dystopian version of America as it recovers from a great war. But those who fail to sustain their pace are mercilessly gunned down after three warnings (and who said cold-blooded killing isn’t motivational?). The last man standing in this open-ended competition is named the “winner,” an accomplishment that entitles him to whatever he wishes as a reward. Symbolism and literary surrealism aside, however, the premise behind this work is utterly absurd, especially since participation in the march is voluntary, a betrayal of one of the principal thematic elements of the source material in allegorically criticizing an underlying inhumane mandate. Given that, then, who in their right mind would sign up for something like this? But, beyond the inherent lunacy of its premise (not to mention its contradictory and countless logically implausible plot elements), the picture fails as a well-crafted, engaging work of cinema. To begin with, it commits the cardinal moviemaking sin of predictability, its narrative events and ultimate outcome largely visible from miles away. Next, its storyline quickly becomes tediously repetitive with only minor deviations in plot devices along the way. Its billing as a horror flick is seriously misplaced, as it’s not particularly scary – just gratuitously gross whose shock value impact and multiple disgusting references to bodily functions fade rapidly by going to the same tiresome well far too many times. And, on top of all that, it’s often terribly boring, loaded with protracted conversations among bland, monodimensional characters that just aren’t especially compelling or profound. The screenplay driving all this appears to draw its inspiration from the narratives in pictures like “Platoon” (1986) and any number of classic World War II buddy films but with less articulate and attention-holding writing. To its credit, the film valiantly attempts to infuse the story with insights related to contemporary social and political issues, though these efforts sadly remain largely underdeveloped. What’s more, there are missed opportunities here, too, such as the picture’s failure to make a definitive statement about the bloodsport nature of the event given its popularity with a rapt, admiring and inexplicably reverential public that’s able to watch the entire spectacle via a live video feed. When all of these elements (or should I say shortcomings?) are combined, you’ve got one ridiculously hot cinematic mess (handily one of the worst releases of 2025), one that probably would have been more aptly titled “Roadkill.” I find it puzzling that this offering from the director of four of the five “Hunger Games” franchise releases was unable to work his magic once again in this release in light of the similar nature of this project. However, in my view, this production misses the mark by such a wide margin that, if the sharp-shooters in this story had an aim comparable to that of the director, no one would have died by the time the closing credits roll. But, then, maybe we would have been better off with a picture that produced such an outcome, given that there’s little redeeming entertainment, enlightenment or educational value in this cinematic debacle. And, no matter what anyone might say, in the end, the Emperor is still naked."

                "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, this isn't a \"good movie 10/10\" type review and I honestly don't know how to write a good one without spoiling things.\r\nI believe these spoilers are necessary to understand just how disappointing the film is and that they don't deter from the movie's \"experience\". You can already guess that half of the characters will die after the first night and that the main character and his best friend will be the last two remaining.\r\n\r\nAlso, art is subjective. The review below is my opinion. I'm not claiming that it's the objective truth.\r\n\r\nWith that said, let's get started.\r\n\r\nWatching The Long Walk felt precisely as the name suggests: it was a long, tedious, bland and repetitive experience.\r\nIt's the worst kind of bad: It wasn't a movie about an alien spaceship suddenly interrupting the participants and abducting The Major. This would've been a \"worse\" movie, but at least an entertaining *experience*.\r\nInstead, The Long Walk feels mundane, relentlessly trying to achieve a tone of philosophical seriousness and spectacularly, being something more than \"just\" a movie (specifically a \"great\" movie, see below), failing to achieve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've structured this review into the four categories I believe make up a \"good movie\": graphics, story, characters (including dialogue) and worldbuilding.\r\nI am specifically not addressing what makes a movie \"great\". A great movie, on top of these four categories, has to educate and elevate. Both of these criteria are not just my opinion, a lot of critics and people working in the scene believe that, too, although they may use different terminology. Feel free to disagree, and let me know if you have a better definition of a \"good\" versus a \"great\" movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graphics were ... okay. As you likely know, the film is live-action (if you’re reading this review, you probably do) and I noticed that the movie uses an anamorphic lens (simple explanation: makes blurry details look oval), which is usually a sign of high-budget filming and professionalism. The colors were pleasant, I didn't find them to be too vivid or too dark. The resolution was also okay, I don't know what the actual resolution was but it didn't *feel* high-res, especially in facial details. However, I only noticed it when I was specifically looking for it, so I'll give the (percieved) resolution a pass.\r\nWhat I did find problematic was the frame rate. The movie had some fast-moving shots close to corn fields in a low frame rate, which made me nauseous, and I normally *never* get anything close to nauseous when watching all kinds of movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple story isn't inherently bad. A movie can excel with a simple story, provided the characters are interesting and well-developed and the worldbuilding is there.\r\nBut I'm not sure how to describe the story of The Long Walk, as there hardly is one. The overarching plot is exactly what the overview suggests: 50 people walking for their lives. What you read is what you get, there's nothing extra, nothing special.\r\nThere are some interesting characters that briefly spice up the story, including our main character Raymond Garraty and his new best friend, Peter McVries, who he meets during the walk. I'll talk more about them in the next part.\r\nWhat was interesting to see, or rather what would've been interesting to see if it didn't fail with the characters and worldbuilding, was Ray's arrival to The Long Walk with his mother and his later reunion with her during the walk. The former was also one of the few instances of worldbuilding in the movie, which I’ll address later.\r\nWhat also really confused me was the timing of the warnings. While some characters got theirs after just seconds of standing still, others could stop for minutes before anything would happen. It took away all immersion (if there was any left, we'll get to that) because it truly felt like the timings were set up to make the movie more dramatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking about the characters is hard, because 75% die after the first day. I will ignore them, because most of them don't contribute anything to the plot. The first day also seemingly only consists of trash talk, which I'm also going to ignore for the most part.\r\n\r\nThe characters in The Long Walk represent a profound missed opportunity. A lot of interesting philosophical and ethical topics are introduced, only for the characters to abruptly abandon them after just a few minutes.\r\n\r\nI'd like to start by talking about the - in my opinion - best-characterized character, Gary Barkovitch.\r\nHe provokes another walker, Rank, into attacking him, leading to Rank’s execution. Not only the characters, but also you as viewer despise him for that. We only later find out that this wasn't actually his intention (?) and he is truly sorry for \"murdering\" Rank. He tries to get back on good terms with the group and shortly after kills himself.\r\nIt's one of the only two instances of character development I could find in the movie. The movie hints at Barkovitch's past, and it’s a shame it doesn’t explore the character more deeply, as the novel does.\r\nBarkovitch's character is thin and his development lacking, but it’s the best the movie offered, and I want to acknowledge that.\r\n\r\nNext, there’s Richard Harkness, the \"nerd\" of the group, and an opposite to Barkovitch. He knows everything about The Long Walk and is participating in hopes of writing a book about it and selling it for profit.\r\nWhat his seemingly large intellect fails to let him realize is that his character's intention don't make any sense. If he doesn't win the walk, he'll die and won't be able to publish his book; if he does, he'll have enough money to not need the book anymore. He's portrayed as a smart character, it makes no sense for him to not have realized this.\r\nFurthermore, when he actually *does* die (because - who would've thought - the main character and his best friend are the last remaining two) his dialogue attempts to hint at some degree of character development (\"I finally understood what The Long Walk is actually about,\" if my memory is correct), which was never shown. His personality remained that of a stereotypical obnoxious nerd throughout the film, until his demise.\r\n\r\nFinally, it’s time to analyze our main character. He'll be the last one I'll talk about, I can't do that anymore.\r\nRay Garraty's wish, if he'll win The Long Walk, is a gun, as he plans to shoot The Major, who killed his dad for spreading \"wrong thoughts and ideas\".\r\nMcVries has to tell him his whole (okay-ish, very generic) backstory, to convince him that love is more important than vengeance. Don't confuse that with character development - Garraty doesn't actually seem to change his stance on the topic. In fact, I'd even call it reverse character development, as it is McVries who wins the race, asks for a gun and shoots The Major. At least it's ... something.\r\nRay's character is one of the only interesting and nuanced ones, as (two) snippets of his backstory are actually shown in the movie. (Yes, only two.) His bond to his mother is one of the few instances I could actually relate to a character. In fact, he actually sees his mother near the end of The Long Walk again, nearly getting all his three warnings, activating his plot armor with some help from McVries and continuing walking right before he's going to be shot. We never see his mother again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to keep the worldbuilding part short. Firstly, because there - who would've guessed - barely is any and because I've already wasted enough time with this review.\r\nFirstly, I want to give credit to the start of the movie where there actually was worldbuilding: We could hear some propaganda coming from the radio, hinting at the political situation of the country, and we could see Ray and his mother talking about The Great Walk in the car.\r\nAfter that, there are only three instances of worldbuilding:\r\n\r\n> Ray's dream about his mom\r\n\r\n> The assassination of Ray's father, with the dream scene copy-pasted in front of it.\r\n\r\n> Peter McVries telling Ray about his background and his life until now (it's not even visualized on screen, they're literally just talking).\r\n\r\n \r\nExcept for these, the only thing we ever see is the street where the walk is being held.\r\nWe do not get any other information about the world the movie plays in.\r\nAnd that's a shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nMystery is a valuable thing. But it needs a foundation - a world where these mysteries can live. The Long Walk failed to build that world - and that's my main gripe with it.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn why The Long Walk got held (beyond the vague reasoning of \"to make the population more productive\").\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what led the world into its current state.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what The Great War was.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn how the people who watched the walk live on TV even reacted to it.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what happened to Collie Parker's wife.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what happened to Ray's mother.\r\n\r\nAnd no, we never lean what happens after The Major got assassinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can't, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone.\r\nAnother review suggested renaming it to \"Roadkill\" and I wholeheartedly agree. This movie is about people being graphically killed for reasons unknown to the viewer, while you wait for something of value to occur. If that doesn't sound interesting to you - please don't watch the movie.\r\nI seriously want my money back, not because of its value to me, but because I don't think Lionsgate deserves it.\r\n\r\nIf you're actually interested in the story the movie tried to tell and the lesson we can learn from it, go read the novel. I read a lot of quotes from the novel while researching for this review, and it truly seems like the story I expected from the movie. Seriously, go read that instead."

This is, in its own way, also a harsh repudiation of state sanctioned violence. Where the young are brutally sacrificed, by the old, in the pursuit of power and control.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact this film is derived from Stephen Kings work, an author I have mixed feelings about, Id characterize it as an \"instant classic\". Thirty years from now this will be as refresh, remarkable, moving and memorable as it was in 2025. \r\n\r\nWhy? Putting aside the more than excellent, intelligently written script, what makes this essentially very simple film shine is polished, quality acting. A rare thing these days, where candy coated CGI and \"doing stuff\" has taken the place of thoughtful, insightful cinema. The acting from the whole cast is  credit worthy but the leads Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, offer up performances that are stark, honestly human, in short, exceptional. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I can't comprehend the negative reviews of this film. Its one of the best I've seen not only this year but in a very long time. A truly compelling watch."

                "content": "Initially, I though this had something of the “Hunger Games” to it, as a group of fifty young men assemble at a military roadblock. It appears they have each won a lottery and a prize of untold riches awaits the winner of a walking competition. The rules are simple. Keep above 3 m.p.h. and don’t stop. “Ray” (Cooper Hoffman) pays an emotion farewell to his mum and joins a group of lads that includes “Pete” (David Jonsson); the somewhat odious “Barkovitch” (Charlie Plummer), talkative “Olson” (Ben Wang) and the lithe and fit looking “Stebbins” (Garrett Wareing) and “Art” (Tut Nyuot). A rousing speech from the “Major” (Mark Hamill) explains the rules to them, and makes clear that it will quite literally be the last man standing who wins. Quickly, “Ray” and “Pete” bond and as they set off, we discover more about what makes these two men tick, interspersed with some lively contributions from their fellow walkers who manage to engage, irritate, offend and motivate as the miles accrue and the numbers dwindle. This takes a fairly intense look at the processes of male bonding and both Hoffman and Jonsson deliver powerfully compelling performances as both characters come to terms with an unpleasant inevitability as hunger and sleep deprivation take their toll. Both Wang and Plummer also deliver unexpectedly charismatic efforts here: a far cry from anything I’ve seen either do before, and though he’s not on screen often, Hamill also manages to exude a degree of malevolent megalomania as this effort to reenergise the not so industrious youth of America travels the country. I felt that it built well to a poignant denouement, but at the moment of truth it rather lost it’s potency and I think it caved in a bit. Still, there is an intensity, a warmth and some vulnerability on show here as both physical and mental endurance are tested to the limits whilst wrapped in a coat of guilt, ambition and increasing inter-reliance. It’s not an easy watch, but as a (less brutal) allegory for so much of modern day, dog-eat-dog life, it works really quite powerfully."

It’s reminiscent of the second Enfield Haunting one (2016) as the Smurl family start to find their home is being terrorised by a spirit that this time has been malevolently lingering on the land that their new home has been built on. Initially, the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are reluctant to get involved, but when a priest is found dangling down the stairwell of the bishop’s residence and then their daughter “Judy” (Mia Tomlinson) - whom we learn had her own near-death experience at birth - gets involved with the struggling and terrified family, it falls to them and her unsuspecting but plucky boyfriend “Tony” (Ben Hardy) to try and save the day before the body count gets any larger. I liked Hardy in “Unicorns” (2023). He brings an enthusiasm to the roles he plays and he actually does fine here. The rest of it, though, is entirely by-the-numbers stuff only now we are in the attic with a mysterious mirror. Every scenario that involves a degree of peril also involves a degree of stupidity. Who walks into a darkened room at the best of times without turning on the light? Let alone when the place is creaking and moaning. Farmiga looks more like she belongs in “Downton Abbey” every time she appears and at well over two hours, this is seriously strung out as it tries to incorporate familial and investigative history into this fairly repetitious series of spooky set-pieces. Sorry, but this just isn’t anyone’s finest hour, the story is pretty unoriginal and I went away hoping that this was, indeed, the last rites."

This is great news for her brother “Johnny” (Joseph Quinn) and the stony fourth member of their gang “Ben” (Egon Moss-Bacharach). The news is greeted enthusiastically by their adoring fans too, but those celebrations are cut short when a mysterious woman descends from what looks like a meteor shower to forewarn them that their planet is doomed. Her (Julia Garner) boss “Galactus” (Ralph Ineson) is on his way, and he is hungry for not just some rare earths, but all of it! Blessed with their array of super-powers, the quartet embark in their warp-capable rocket to meet this chap and he offers them an alternative to global destruction. It’s one hell of a sacrifice for the would-be parents though, but with the fate of humanity hanging on their decision - what will they choose? Perhaps they can think of a scientific alternative? There is a slightly retro-look to the production, with their flying car looking like a converted Citroën that belonged in a Jacques Tati film, and there is plenty of inter-galactic adventure with some effective visual effects, a decent degree of menace and it stays sufficiently devoid of sentiment, and the multiverse, until the denouement. Though they do gel well together, none of the acting isn’t really anything special, nor is the writing, but “Ben” looks good with his beard and Quinn probably steals the show with his engagingly flaming character and his spray-on white 501s. There are loads of gadgets and gizmos and anyone who has ever had to argue with a child seat and a car might empathise, too. It’s an old-fashioned save the world movie that hasn’t sold it’s soul to the CGI, and I enjoyed it."

Maybe it’s the bright colors or the fact that H.E.R.B.I.E. is featured so prominently, but the first half of the film feels like a multi-episode arc of The Jetsons.\r\n\r\nThings are lighthearted and fairly silly until The Silver Surfer shows up. But The Fantastic Four and James Gunn’s Superman seem to be honoring the silver age of comic books, which is a welcome change for superhero films.  \r\n\r\nOddly, the marketing makes it seem like the family bond amongst The Fantastic Four is so strong because it doesn’t seem that great while watching it. The film isn’t an origin story, as you only get a brief montage of how they got their powers. But there’s a lot of indecisiveness amongst the team with Franklin on the way. The way time passes in the film is weird. Sue’s pregnancy and Franklin’s age (apart from a certain time jump) seem accelerated, and it’s difficult to decipher if that much time has passed (nine months for the pregnancy, plus however many additional months Franklin is supposed to be) or if it’s fast-tracked because they all have powers.\r\n\r\nThe casting in The Fantastic Four: First Steps is fine, but they still seem to be finding a rhythm as a team. Reed’s brain works in a way that has him thinking of the worst scenarios, while his plans and logic stem from building everything around the most horrible solution. Sue just wants her baby to thrive in the presence of a loving family. She doesn’t want to give him to Galactus or decide his fate if he happens to have powers. She wants him to live and flourish with his own identity and choices.\r\n\r\nThe film seems to hint at Johnny being a womanizer, but he’s painfully single here. He latches onto The Silver Surfer and devotes a good chunk of the film to learning her language just so he can talk to her. The fate of the world may be at stake, sure, but dat silver ass has light years to travel and he’s got to make his moves now.\r\n\r\nBen is kinda boring, honestly. He shows interest in Rachel Rozman (Natasha Lyonne) and returning to the places that remind him of what it’s like to feel normal, but unless he’s destroying something or lifting a car over his head, he’s a little forgettable. He isn’t conflicted enough and doesn’t clobber enough things to leave a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nReed and Sue have noticeable chemistry, and they should given that they’re married. And Johnny and Ben have this macho kind of bro energy where they’re always ribbing each other and yet also sarcastically supporting one another (Ben’s beard, Johnny referring to himself in third person). As a foursome and a team, though, they still seem to be lacking, like they’re still learning to coordinate cohesively instead of Reed or Sue calling it on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place four years after the cosmic storm that caused them to gain their powers. But maybe the “first steps” part of the title refers to them still learning to work together as a team, as well as Franklin’s first baby steps.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects are mostly extremely impressive, with a few noticeable green screen shots and face animations being the only funky inclusions. The Silver Surfer’s face looks awkward at times, like it isn’t properly centered on Julia Garner’s body, or something. I wasn’t a huge fan of how the Human Torch looked either. His body is just orange with some lazy flames at the sides that don’t even cover his entire body.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Surfer chase sequences in the wormhole are some of the best the MCU has ever done. There was a bit of an uproar amongst the internet community when The Silver Surfer turned out to be female in this, but the character is given the coolest moments in the film and arguably the film’s most emotional sequence apart from the film’s finale. It's been apparent since Doctor Strange has been hinting at it in both of his films, but the MCU needs to go fully cosmic for its next phase.\r\n\r\nDespite being beloved around the world and being a team for a decent amount of time, it feels like The Fantastic Four are still working out the kinks of being a solid team in First Steps. The performances are solid, the chemistry amongst the cast is great, and there are sentimental moments sprinkled throughout the entire film. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of promise in what the future of the MCU holds with this version of The Fantastic Four, and it’s somewhat of a relief to have a Fantastic Four film that is actually worthwhile and hopefully worth revisiting with fondness instead of regret."

Storyline is not too complicated. It is a simple predictable story without too much twisted plots or surprises. Nonetheless, the storytelling is captivating and you don’t realize how the 1:30 hr passed. Acting is pretty decent, Pedro Pascal shines in his acting. There is no typical Marvel BS in this movie.\r\n\r\nIf I had seen this movie about 15 years ago, I would have called it an average. But I am so sick and fatigued with crap movies these days, that even a normal movie like this feels good.\r\n\r\nOverall it is worth watching."

                "content": "There’s a distinctive charm to “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” a refreshing, visually inventive take on the MCU formula. Director Matt Shakman brings Marvel’s First Family into a retro-futuristic 1960s setting that makes the movie stand out from the typical summer superhero fare. Shakman delivers a world of bold colors, bubble-helmeted scientists, and sleek, sci-fi tech that’s unexpectedly delightful, if a bit slow moving.\r\n\r\nReed Richards (Pedro Pascal) and his wife Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) have their first baby on the way. They, along with Reed’s brother-in-law Johnny (Joseph Quinn) and best friend Ben (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), are excited to welcome a new bundle of joy into their home. But when a mysterious woman known as Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) shows up with a dire warning from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson), Sue and Reed are given an impossible choice: give up their newborn son to save Earth, or let the entire planet be destroyed. \r\n\r\nThis conflict sounds compelling, but it’s also where the film stumbles. Galactus is more of a looming concept than a compelling villain, with motivations that feel too impersonal and very vague. Silver Surfer is a terrific character with an interesting back story, but the movie never quite gives her enough to do. The Four aren’t bogged down with an elaborate origin story either, and it works well here. They’re already established by the time we meet them, which allows for more time spent on character dynamics. I could see how casual audiences who are less familiar with the comic book characters could find the lack of an origin story disappointing, but the actors and their chemistry more than make up for it. \r\n\r\nThe film leans into its “found family” theme with heart and sincerity, placing an emphasis on character over spectacle. The strong performances from the cast boost the film’s overall credibility, and the special effects are (admittedly) top notch. The themes lean heavily on the idea that family is not only biological, but also can be chosen, and there’s a nice balance between the need to be superheroes as well as parents and a strongly bonded family.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is plenty to like here, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” isn’t a movie I’d ever want to revisit. I can’t honestly say that I’m excited to see any of these characters in future films, and I actually found the Four to be a little bit boring. And while it’s so nice to see a Marvel film that isn’t trying desperately to be forcefully stuffed into some extended universe timeline, the movie doesn’t entirely escape the studio’s usual pitfalls.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS"

Rumi was born part-demon, right? Her mother was a demon hunter and her father was a demon, which implies that not all demons are evil, right? Yes? No? We are never told how Rumi's mother died and we are never told what happened to Rumi's father, but I highly doubt that Rumi's mother was tricked into a relationship by a demon long enough to have a child.\r\n2. All demons are supposed to be banished when the Honmoon is sealed, so how the heck is the cat and the crow still there, also, why do we even have a demon cat and crow? They're cute, but what are they? Are there \"true demons\" like Gwi-Ma, the cat and the crow, and \"enslaved demons\" like Jinu and his boy band?\r\n3. Gwi-Ma enslaves other demons and practically tortures them with their shame for all eternity and we end the movie by permanently trapping them all in the demon realm with him? Really? Even though Jinu shows that demons can be redeemed by... showing them kindness and forgiveness?! REALLY?! Okay!\r\n\r\nThe last one is my biggest issue with the plot.\r\n\r\nAs for my issues with the representation of K-pop idols; their lives are only glamorous on the surface. K-pop idols are not born, they're made.\r\n\r\nThese kids go through hell, for lack of a better way to describe it. It's not so much an issue with the K-pop industry itself, as it's a \"cultural\" issue. Koreans push themselves and each other to the brink, and it can and does lead to suicide.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.\r\n\r\nThe movie shows our K-pop protagonists snacking out and enjoying life, when in reality, these kids are on a strict diet and are allegedly not allowed these things.\r\n\r\nI like the movie, but I've read too much about the real lives of K-pop idols to overlook the glamorized misrepresentation shown here."

The animation is so colorful and creative that it’s like a kaleidoscope explosion! The music is catchy and upbeat, and the story is layered with depth and emotion. Arden Cho and the rest of the voice cast do amazing jobs bringing the characters to life. The main character, Rumi, is on a journey of self-discovery, and it’s really heartwarming to see how much they grow and learn. The film does have a few minor flaws, like some uneven tones and underdeveloped secondary characters, but overall, it’s a fun and entertaining fantasy parody of pop culture. It’s a must-watch for anyone who loves K-pop, anime, and just great storytelling."
